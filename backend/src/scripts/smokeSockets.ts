/**
 * End-to-end smoke test for socket-driven gameplay.
 *
 *   1. Start the backend: npx tsx src/index.ts (separate terminal)
 *   2. Run this script: npx tsx src/scripts/smokeSockets.ts
 *
 * Simulates a full casual PvP game:
 *   alice creates → bob joins → both set codes → alice guesses bob's
 *   code on her first try → game_over fires with alice as winner.
 *
 * The "alice cracks first try" is possible because we deterministically
 * set Bob's code to 1234 and alice guesses 1234. Proves the rule engine,
 * turn switching, game-over detection, and event broadcast all work.
